# CalculatorApp
This is a simple calculator app for Android devices. This is a small project that to help familiarize myself with Android development. The app is wrriten in Java and has two different layouts, one for portrait and one for landscape. Additionally, I used bundles to save the states of some variables when switching toggling the orientation of the app.
